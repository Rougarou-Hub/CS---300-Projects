# CS---300-Projects

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The primary problem was that a program had to be created to read and display the relevant data file.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

In order to tackle the problem over the term we developed multiple smaller portions our pseudocode, and then used this pseudocode to full complete a working program to complete the data structure. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

Overall this project was a simple one, I found adding the excel document and making sure it was reading was a bit difficult, but once you understand how to do it gonig forward it isn't an issue. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This project was my first step into developing a program that had relevancy to data strcutures and pushed me to learn new things that I have yet to tackle during my pursuit of my bachelors in computer science. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Everytime we code, you learn a little more, in a way I find its just like learning to write for the first time all over again. You learn a rule here or there, and that translate forward as you keep going foward, learning where certain commands belong, what they do, when to use them, etc.
